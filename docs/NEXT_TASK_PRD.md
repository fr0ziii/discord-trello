# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Board Discord Channel Integration

## üìã Overview

### Project Name
Discord-Trello Bot - Multi-Board Channel Integration (Phase 3 Enhancement)

### Problem Statement
Currently, the Discord-Trello bot operates with a single Trello board configuration for all Discord channels. This limitation restricts teams from organizing different projects, departments, or workflows into separate boards, forcing all tasks into one centralized location regardless of context.

### Solution
Implement intelligent multi-board support that allows different Discord channels to map to specific Trello boards and lists, enabling team-based organization, project separation, and departmental segregation while maintaining all existing AI and webhook functionality.

## üéØ Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Multi-Board Mapping**: Enable different Discord channels to connect to different Trello boards
- **Persistent Configuration**: Store channel-to-board mappings in a database for reliability
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing single-board functionality as default
- **Admin Control**: Provide management commands for board configuration
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support unlimited board configurations

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Support for 50+ channel-to-board mappings per Discord server
- ‚úÖ Zero downtime during configuration changes
- ‚úÖ 100% backward compatibility with existing installations
- ‚úÖ Sub-200ms response time for board lookups
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to default board when mapping not found

## üßë‚Äçüíº Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Team Leads**: Managing multiple projects across different channels
- **DevOps Teams**: Separating development, staging, and production workflows
- **Enterprise Users**: Departmental segregation (Marketing, Sales, Support, Engineering)

### Secondary Users
- **Project Managers**: Cross-functional project organization
- **Community Servers**: Different interest groups with separate boards
- **Educational Institutions**: Class-specific or department-specific boards

## üì± Features and Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Channel-to-Board Mapping System
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Real-time channel-to-board mapping updates
- **Multiple Mappings**: One Discord server can map to multiple Trello boards
- **Granular Control**: Channel-specific board AND list targeting
- **Inheritance**: Channels can inherit parent category mappings
- **Override System**: Specific channel mappings override category defaults

#### 2. Enhanced Command System
```
!t config board <board-id> [list-id]     # Configure current channel
!t config show                           # Show current channel configuration
!t config list                           # List all server configurations
!t config remove                         # Remove current channel configuration
!t config default <board-id> <list-id>   # Set server default board
!t admin boards                          # Show all accessible boards (admin only)
!t admin reset                           # Reset all configurations (admin only)
```

#### 3. Persistent Storage System
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, embedded database for configuration storage
- **Configuration Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE channel_mappings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    guild_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    board_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    list_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(guild_id, channel_id)
  );
  ```

#### 4. Intelligent Webhook Routing
- **Multi-Board Webhooks**: Register webhooks for each configured board
- **Smart Notification Routing**: Send notifications to appropriate Discord channels
- **Webhook Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate webhook registrations
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove unused webhooks when configurations change

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Template and Import System
- **Board Templates**: Pre-configured board setups for common use cases
- **Bulk Configuration**: Import multiple channel mappings from JSON/CSV
- **Export Configuration**: Backup current server configuration
- **Migration Tools**: Move configurations between servers

#### 2. AI-Enhanced Board Management
- **Smart Board Detection**: AI suggests appropriate boards based on channel names/topics
- **Auto-Configuration**: Propose channel-to-board mappings for new servers
- **Content Analysis**: Recommend board organization based on task patterns
- **Usage Analytics**: Track board utilization across channels

#### 3. Advanced Permission System
- **Role-Based Access**: Restrict board configuration to specific Discord roles
- **Board Permissions**: Validate user access to target Trello boards
- **Audit Logging**: Track all configuration changes with user attribution
- **Approval Workflows**: Require approval for board configuration changes
